`aionotion` is a Python 3, asyncio-friendly library for interacting with [Notion][notion]
home monitoring sensors.

# Installation

```bash
pip install aionotion
```

# Python Versions

`aionotion` is currently supported on:

- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.12

# Usage

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aionotion import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session=session)

    # Get all "households" associated with the account:
    response = await client.system.async_all()
    # >>> [System(...), System(...), ...]

    # Get a system by ID:
    response = await client.system.async_get(12345)
    # >>> System(...)

    # Create a system (with associated parameters):
    response = await client.system.async_create({"system_id": 12345, "name": "Test"})
    # >>> System(...)

    # Update a system with new parameters:
    response = await client.system.async_update(12345, {"name": "Test"})
    # >>> System(...)

    # Delete a system by ID:
    await client.system.async_delete(12345)

    # Get all bridges associated with the account:
    response = await client.bridge.async_all()
    # >>> [Bridge(...), Bridge(...), ...]

    # Get a bridge by ID:
    response = await client.bridge.async_get(12345)
    # >>> Bridge(...)

    # Create a bridge (with associated parameters):
    response = await client.bridge.async_create({"system_id": 12345, "name": "Test"})
    # >>> Bridge(...)

    # Update a bridge with new parameters:
    response = await client.bridge.async_update(12345, {"name": "Test"})
    # >>> Bridge(...)

    # Reset a bridge (deprovision its WiFi credentials):
    response = await client.bridge.async_reset(12345)
    # >>> Bridge(...)

    # Delete a bridge by ID:
    await client.bridge.async_delete(12345)

    # Get all devices associated with the account:
    response = await client.device.async_all()
    # >>> [Device(...), Device(...), ...]

    # Get a device by ID:
    response = await client.device.async_get(12345)
    # >>> Device(...)

    # Create a device (with associated parameters):
    response = await client.device.async_create({"id": 12345})
    # >>> Device(...)

    # Delete a device by ID:
    await client.device.async_delete(12345)

    # Get all sensors:
    response = await client.sensor.async_all()
    # >>> [Sensor(...), Sensor(...), ...]

    # Get a sensor by ID:
    response = await client.sensor.async_get(12345)
    # >>> Sensor(...)

    # Get "listeners" (conditions that a sensor is monitoring) for all sensors:
    response = await client.sensor.async_listeners()
    # >>> [Listener(...), Listener(...), ...]

    # Get "listeners" (conditions that a sensor is monitoring) for a specific sensor;
    # note that unlike other sensor endpoints, this one requires the sensor UUID, *not*
    # the sensor ID:
    response = await client.sensor.async_listeners_for_sensor(
        "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    )
    # >>> [Listener(...), Listener(...), ...]

    # Create a sensor (with associated parameters):
    response = await client.sensor.async_create({"sensor_id": 12345, "name": "Test"})
    # >>> Sensor(...)

    # Update a sensor with new parameters:
    response = await client.sensor.async_update(12345, {"name": "Test"})
    # >>> Sensor(...)

    # Delete a sensor by ID:
    await client.sensor.async_delete(12345)

    # Get user preferences:
    user_preferences = await client.user.async_preferences()
    # >>> UserPreferencesResponse(...)


asyncio.run(main())
```

By default, the library creates a new connection to Notion with each coroutine. If you
are calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every second of
runtime savings possible), an [`aiohttp`][aiohttp] `ClientSession` can be used for
connection pooling:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aionotion import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        # Create a Notion API client:
        client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session=session)

        # Get to work...


asyncio.run(main())
```

signatures and more examples.
