`aionotion` is a Python 3, asyncio-friendly library for interacting with
[Notion](https://getnotion.com) home monitoring sensors.

# Python Versions

`aionotion` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.5
* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7

However, running the test suite currently requires Python 3.6 or higher; tests
run on Python 3.5 will fail.

# Installation

```python
pip install aionotion
```

# Usage

`aionotion` starts within an
[aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) `ClientSession`:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
      # YOUR CODE HERE


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

Create a client and get to work:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aionotion import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
        # Create a Notion API client:
        client = await async_get_client('<EMAIL>', '<PASSWORD>', websession)

        # Get all "households" associated with the account:
        systems = await client.system.async_all()

        # Get a system by ID:
        system = await client.system.async_get(12345)

        # Create a system (with associated parameters):
        await client.system.async_create({"system_id": 12345, "name": "Test"})

        # Update a system with new parameters:
        await client.system.async_update(12345, {"name": "Test"})

        # Delete a system by ID:
        await client.system.async_delete(12345)

        # Get all bridges associated with the account:
        bridges = await client.bridge.async_all()

        # Get a bridge by ID:
        bridge = await client.bridge.async_get(12345)

        # Create a bridge (with associated parameters):
        await client.bridge.async_create({"system_id": 12345, "name": "Test"})

        # Update a bridge with new parameters:
        await client.bridge.async_update(12345, {"name": "Test"})

        # Reset a bridge (deprovision its WiFi credentials):
        await client.bridge.async_reset(12345)

        # Delete a bridge by ID:
        await client.bridge.async_delete(12345)

        # Get all devices associated with the account:
        devices = await client.device.async_all()

        # Get a device by ID:
        device = await client.device.async_get(12345)

        # Create a device (with associated parameters):
        await client.device.async_create({"id": 12345})

        # Delete a device by ID:
        await client.device.async_delete(12345)

        # Get all sensors:
        sensors = await client.sensor.async_all()

        # Get a sensor by ID:
        sensor = await client.sensor.async_get(12345)

        # Create a sensor (with associated parameters):
        await client.sensor.async_create({"sensor_id": 12345, "name": "Test"})

        # Update a sensor with new parameters:
        await client.sensor.async_update(12345, {"name": "Test"})

        # Delete a sensor by ID:
        await client.sensor.async_delete(12345)

        # Get all "tasks" (conditions monitored by sensors) associated with the account:
        tasks = await client.task.async_all()

        # Get a task by ID:
        task = await client.task.async_get("xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx")

        # Get a task's value history between two datetimes:
        import datetime
        history = await client.task.async_history(
            "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
            data_before=datetime.datetime.now(),
            data_after=datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=3),
        )

        # Create a list of tasks for a particular sensor (e.g., sensor # 12345):
        await client.task.async_create(
            12345, [{"id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "type": "missing"}]
        )

        # Delete a task for a particular sensor (e.g., sensor # 12345):
        await client.task.async_delete(12345, "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx")


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```
