`aionotion` is a Python 3, asyncio-friendly library for interacting with
[Notion](https://getnotion.com) home monitoring sensors.

# Python Versions

`aionotion` is currently supported on:

- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11

# Installation

```bash
pip install aionotion
```

# Usage

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aionotion import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session=session)

    # Get all "households" associated with the account:
    systems = await client.system.async_all()

    # Get a system by ID:
    system = await client.system.async_get(12345)

    # Create a system (with associated parameters):
    await client.system.async_create({"system_id": 12345, "name": "Test"})

    # Update a system with new parameters:
    await client.system.async_update(12345, {"name": "Test"})

    # Delete a system by ID:
    await client.system.async_delete(12345)

    # Get all bridges associated with the account:
    bridges = await client.bridge.async_all()

    # Get a bridge by ID:
    bridge = await client.bridge.async_get(12345)

    # Create a bridge (with associated parameters):
    await client.bridge.async_create({"system_id": 12345, "name": "Test"})

    # Update a bridge with new parameters:
    await client.bridge.async_update(12345, {"name": "Test"})

    # Reset a bridge (deprovision its WiFi credentials):
    await client.bridge.async_reset(12345)

    # Delete a bridge by ID:
    await client.bridge.async_delete(12345)

    # Get all devices associated with the account:
    devices = await client.device.async_all()

    # Get a device by ID:
    device = await client.device.async_get(12345)

    # Create a device (with associated parameters):
    await client.device.async_create({"id": 12345})

    # Delete a device by ID:
    await client.device.async_delete(12345)

    # Get all sensors:
    sensors = await client.sensor.async_all()

    # Get a sensor by ID:
    sensor = await client.sensor.async_get(12345)

    # Create a sensor (with associated parameters):
    await client.sensor.async_create({"sensor_id": 12345, "name": "Test"})

    # Update a sensor with new parameters:
    await client.sensor.async_update(12345, {"name": "Test"})

    # Delete a sensor by ID:
    await client.sensor.async_delete(12345)

    # Get all "tasks" (conditions monitored by sensors) associated with the account:
    tasks = await client.task.async_all()

    # Get a task by ID:
    task = await client.task.async_get("xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx")

    # Get a task's value history between two datetimes:
    import datetime

    history = await client.task.async_history(
        "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        data_before=datetime.datetime.now(),
        data_after=datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=3),
    )

    # Create a list of tasks for a particular sensor (e.g., sensor # 12345):
    await client.task.async_create(
        12345, [{"id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "type": "missing"}]
    )

    # Delete a task for a particular sensor (e.g., sensor # 12345):
    await client.task.async_delete(12345, "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx")


asyncio.run(main())
```

By default, the library creates a new connection to Notion with each coroutine. If you
are calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every second of
runtime savings possible), an
[`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) `ClientSession` can be used for connection
pooling:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aionotion import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as session:
        # Create a Notion API client:
        client = await async_get_client("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session=session)

        # Get to work...


asyncio.run(main())
```
