`aionotion` is a Python 3, asyncio-friendly library for interacting with
[Notion](https://getnotion.com) home monitoring sensors.

# Python Versions

`aionotion` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.5
* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7

However, running the test suite currently requires Python 3.6 or higher; tests
run on Python 3.5 will fail.

# Installation

```python
pip install aionotion
```

# Usage

`aionotion` starts within an
[aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) `ClientSession`:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
      # YOUR CODE HERE


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

Create a client and get to work:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aionotion import async_get_client


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
        client = await async_get_client('<EMAIL>', '<PASSWORD>')

        # Get all "households" associated with the account:
        systems = await client.async_get_systems()

        # Get all base stations associated with the account:
        base_stations = await client.async_get_base_stations()

        # Get all sensors associated with the account:
        sensors = await client.async_get_sensors()

        # Get all "tasks" (readings from sensors) associated with the account:
        tasks = await client.async_get_tasks()


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

Check out `example.py`, the tests, and the source files themselves for method
signatures and more examples.
